## Hi there 👋
 I'm Joshua Olayemi 🔬 Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist 

🧠 About Me: I'm a store manager turned machine learning engineer, passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. With expertise in machine learning, statistical programming, and data mining, I specialize in developing predictive models that drive strategic decision-making. I believe in creating longer tables and shorter fences, fostering collaboration and innovation.

📈 Projects Here are some of my notable projects:

🔗 Interconnect A telecom company exploring predictions of when clients would leave. By discovering at-risk clients, the company plans to offer them incentives to stay.

🖼️ Image Data Generator (Computer Vision) Utilized Keras' ImageDataGenerator to augment image datasets for deep learning in computer vision. Visualized real-time image transformations to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
